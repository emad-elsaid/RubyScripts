# Daily Ruby Scripts

i create a new script everyday, scripts for dealing with facebook
twitter, github, making simple games and illustrate some ruby magic

i always take a snapshot from the code and draw arrows and comments
over it, so all scripts are compressed in syntax to fit within one
screen, this approach makes my task even more challenging.

hope my scripts gets you inspired at your work, or even makes you
jealous and port them, enhance them, or even create your own ideas,

each day i create a directory with the today's date and put my code
facebook long message, and twitter tweet and post them to several 
place Facebook, Twitter, Tumblr, Google+, Linkedin, Coderwall, Gist
and a long list of other websites, in addition to committing to this
repository.

feel free to fork this repository and enhance whatever script you
want, just show the world how you code, think and do magic with
your keyboard.
